#Notes for Clustering
Two types of inputs for clustering : Data matrix (X), distance matrix(D)
- X to D : easy with a given distance measure
- D to X :e.g. multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)

clustering methods:
K-means
K-medoids, Partition aorund medoids

Methods for selecting K:
Gap statistics
Silhouettes statistics
Prediction strength
